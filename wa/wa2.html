        <p>
        Hi, my name is <strong>Isah Rosales</strong> and my favorite princess is Princess Auoroa. My pronouns are She/Her/Hers. 
        I am a senior pursing a dual emphasis in Marketing and Business Analytics.
        During my junior year I decided to add a CTD minor to my degree and 
        while I don't know what to expect from this class, I'm excited to see what I'll be able to learn!

            My favorite show at the moment is Smallville starring Tom Welling, which I just finished. Now that I don't have any new episodes to watch,
            I decided to start watching the rewatch podcast with the two leads from the show linked <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmoWiMfqAmg&t=3086s">here.</a>
