        <h2>Elizabeth Taylor</h2>
            <p>
            Elizabeth Taylor (born February 27, 1932, London, England—died March 23, 2011, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) was an American film actress who was noted for her unique beauty and her portrayals of volatile and strong-willed characters. Taylor won Academy Awards for her performances in Butterfield 8 (1960) and Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). Off-screen, she garnered attention for her personal life and for her philanthropy.

        <h2>Conrad "Nicky" Hilton Jr. (1950-1951)</h2>
        <p>
            On May 6, 1950, at the age of 18, Elizabeth Taylor married the heir to the Hilton hotel fortune, 24-year-old Conrad “Nicky” Hilton Jr. Unfortunately, what began as a fairy tale quickly became a nightmare. Elizabeth endured both mental and physical abuse (that resulted in a miscarriage), leading her to file for divorce just eight months into the marriage.

        <h2>Michael Wilding (1952-1957)</h2>
        <p>
            Michael Wilding, a distinguished actor 20 years her senior, brought a sense of security and peace into Elizabeth’s life. During their five-year marriage, they had two sons, Michael Howard Wilding and Christopher Edward Wilding. Despite Michael’s resume, Elizabeth was already a huge star and he struggled to accept that his wife had become the primary financial provider. Their marriage eventually ended in 1957, but Elizabeth always spoke fondly of Michael and he remained a cherished part of her life, even after they parted ways.

        <h2>Mike Todd (1957-1958)</h2>
        <p>
            Producer Mike Todd was one of Elizabeth’s true great loves. They married in 1957, and Elizabeth maintained that he was the one she would have stayed with forever. Their marriage was further blessed by the birth of their daughter, Liza Todd. Tragically, their love story was cut short when Mike died in a plane crash in March 1958, just a year after their wedding and seven months after Liza was born.

       <h2>Eddie Fisher (1959-1964)</h2>
       <p>
        After Mike Todd’s tragic death, Elizabeth sought solace and comfort in the arms of Mike’s close friend Eddie Fisher, a renowned singer who famously left his wife, Debbie Reynolds, for her. The scandal surrounding their affair was massive, with the public's fascination and media frenzy reaching a fever pitch. The intense scrutiny and controversy of their relationship led many to turn their backs on Elizabeth, who found herself at the center of a global scandal. As the initial excitement wore off, their relationship began to unravel.

    <h2>Richard Burton (1964-1974, 1975-1976)</h2>
        <p>
        Richard Burton — the love of her life and the man she married twice! Their relationship was fiery, passionate, and studded with diamonds. They made global headlines, starring in eleven films together and becoming one of the most famous couples in the world. After a decade of tumultuous love, they divorced, remarried, and divorced again. If there’s one thing they proved, it’s that some love stories are too big for one marriage.

    <h2>John Warner (1976-1982)</h2>
        <p>
        Elizabeth met her sixth husband, John Warner, on a blind date when he escorted her to a dinner hosted by Queen Elizabeth at the British Embassy in Washington, D.C. Although he had retired from his role as Secretary of the Navy by the time they met, Elizabeth played a pivotal role in his political career. She was instrumental in his election to the Senate, and even he gave her full credit for his success. They married the same year they met, but life in politics stifled Elizabeth’s true nature, and the marriage ended after six years.

    <h2>Larry Fortensky (1991-1996)</h2>
        <p>
        A construction worker twenty years her junior, Larry Fortensky caught Elizabeth’s eye during her second visit to the Betty Ford Center in 1988. Her eighth and final marriage, officiated by Marianne Willaimson, was a spectacle even by Hollywood’s standards. On October 6, 1991, close to two hundred high-profile guests, and 13 paparazzi in helicopters above, watched the couple say “yes” to Forever under a white gazebo at Michael Jackson’s infamous Neverland Ranch. They said their goodbyes as husband and wife in 1996, but Elizabeth never stopped caring for him.
